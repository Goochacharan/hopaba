# Online Presence Feature Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a real-time online presence system that shows when both parties in a conversation are online. The feature displays an "ONLINE" tag next to the service name in conversation headers when both the service provider and requester are actively using the platform.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Real-time Presence Tracking (`src/hooks/usePresence.ts`)
- Uses Supabase's real-time presence feature
- Tracks user online/offline status in real-time
- Creates conversation-specific presence channels
- Automatically handles user join/leave events

### 2. Online Indicator Component (`src/components/ui/online-indicator.tsx`)
- Reusable component showing green dot + "ONLINE" text
- Configurable size (sm, md, lg) and text visibility
- Animated green dot for visual appeal
- Only shows when users are actually online

### 3. Updated Components with Online Status

#### ConversationHeader (`src/components/messaging/ConversationHeader.tsx`)
- Shows online indicator when both parties are online
- Positioned next to the service name as requested
- Uses conversation-specific presence tracking

#### RequestConversationsPanel (`src/components/messaging/RequestConversationsPanel.tsx`)
- Shows online status in conversation lists
- Helps users identify active conversations

#### MessagesListing (`src/pages/MessagesListing.tsx`)
- Displays online indicators in the main messages list
- Refactored for better component organization

#### Messages Page (`src/pages/Messages.tsx`)
- Initializes presence tracking for conversations
- Enables real-time status updates

## Database Fix (CRITICAL)

### Issue Identified
The main issue was with Row Level Security (RLS) policies. The current policy only allows users to see their own service requests:

```sql
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own requests" ON "public"."service_requests" 
FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

This means service providers could only see requests they created themselves, not requests from other users who need services.

### Solution
I've created a fix that needs to be applied to your Supabase database. Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Drop the existing restrictive policy
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own requests" ON "public"."service_requests";

-- Create a new policy that allows service providers to see open requests
CREATE POLICY "Users can view requests" ON "public"."service_requests"
FOR SELECT USING (
  -- Users can always see their own requests
  auth.uid() = user_id 
  OR 
  -- All authenticated users can see open requests
  (status = 'open' AND auth.uid() IS NOT NULL)
);
```

## How to Test

### 1. Apply Database Fix
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Run the SQL from `fix_service_requests_rls.sql`
4. Verify the policy was created successfully

### 2. Test Service Request Visibility
1. Create a service request with one user account
2. Log in as a different user who has a service provider profile
3. Navigate to "Service Requests" or "Provider Inbox"
4. Verify that the request created by the first user is now visible

### 3. Test Online Presence
1. Open the app in two different browsers/incognito windows
2. Log in as different users (one requester, one provider)
3. Start a conversation between them
4. Both users should see the "ONLINE" tag appear in the conversation header
5. Close one browser - the online tag should disappear
6. Reopen - the tag should reappear

### 4. Test Real-time Updates
1. With both users online in a conversation
2. One user sends a message
3. The other user should see the message appear in real-time
4. Online status should remain visible throughout

## Technical Details

### Presence Channels
- Each conversation gets its own presence channel: `presence:conversation-{conversationId}`
- General presence tracking uses: `presence:general`
- Automatic cleanup when users leave or close the app

### Online Status Logic
- Current user online: `isUserOnline(user.id)`
- Other party online: `isUserOnline(otherPartyUserId)`
- Both online: `currentUserOnline && otherPartyOnline`
- Only shows indicator when BOTH parties are online

### Performance Considerations
- Presence data is cached and updated in real-time
- Minimal API calls due to Supabase's efficient real-time system
- Automatic cleanup prevents memory leaks

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `src/hooks/usePresence.ts` - Presence tracking hook
- `src/components/ui/online-indicator.tsx` - Online status component
- `fix_service_requests_rls.sql` - Database fix script

### Modified Files
- `src/components/messaging/ConversationHeader.tsx` - Added online indicator
- `src/components/messaging/RequestConversationsPanel.tsx` - Added presence tracking
- `src/pages/MessagesListing.tsx` - Added online indicators
- `src/pages/Messages.tsx` - Initialize presence tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the database fix** - This is critical for the service request visibility issue
2. **Test the online presence feature** - Follow the testing steps above
3. **Monitor performance** - Check if real-time updates work smoothly
4. **Consider enhancements** - Could add "last seen" timestamps, typing indicators, etc.

The implementation provides a solid foundation for real-time presence tracking and solves the core issue of service request visibility between different users.
